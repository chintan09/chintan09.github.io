>*New House, new month, new hopes* - [@amrita_damani](https://twitter.com/amrita_damani)


------------------------------------------------------------
This email list is born of a recurring thought that since I spend a quiet a bit of time online reading about variety of stuff, I should share it with close friends. I usually use twitter for sharing those interesting links, but it's not the best medium for sharing as its difficult to catch up with every tweets. Thus this idea came into life on one friday night.

So far I really don't have any particular goals around this newsletter, except for the fact that I promise to send one news letter every week. It would mostly contain interesting stories from around the web and then see how it grows.

Without further ado lets get started with this week's short edition.


------------------------------------------------------------
[This internal email from Apple in 2010](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/9858/564763/EbGR9kXSYfwJJ2X/DX489%20Rev%2003-07-14.pdf) is really interesting to go through, would definitely give some insights about how Steve thought about Apple.

"its easy to get distracted. everyone thinks we are much better than we actually are. be humble and honest about the fact that more is left to do than has already been done. keep moving quickly and don’t get bogged down in the things that don’t matter."
[Chamath Palihapitiya's last day email at Facebook](http://www.quora.com/Resignations/What-are-noteworthy-last-day-emails-written-by-employees/answer/Andy-Johns?srid=8qJ&share=1) . He is such an inspiration.

[2048 Game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) , if you haven't caught up with it yet; now is the chance to spend your weekend away!
